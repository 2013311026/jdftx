Constructing a slab-geometry calculation (specifically graphene) from graphite
in the \ref TwoDmaterials tutorial was easy: graphite already consisted of distinct layers.
This tutorial shows you how to manually set up single-crystal platinum surfaces
of various orientations, starting from supercell transformations,
and then shows examples of surface property calculations in vacuum and solution.


## Geometry setup

Let's start with the geometry of bulk platinum, written using
explicit lattice vectors rather than the shorthand lattice name:

    set aBy2 3.705   #a/2 in bohrs
    lattice \
           0    ${aBy2} ${aBy2} \
        ${aBy2}    0    ${aBy2} \
        ${aBy2} ${aBy2}    0
    
    ion Pt 0. 0. 0.  1

Note that the lattice vectors are in columns of the 3x3 matrix ,
and we have used variable substitution along with the set command
(see \ref Commands) to declare the lattice constant in one place.

We can construct a surface unit cell in three steps.
First we transform the unit cell (construct a supercell)
in a way that allows us to identify layers with the desired
surface direction, so that we can cleave the material.
Then we repeat this supercell along the surface normal direction
till there is enough room for the desired number of atomic layers and the vacuum gap.
Finally, we keep atoms from a desired number of layers and drop the rest
to create a slab with two surfaces, separated by a vacuum gap along the third direction
(which we will make non-periodic using slab-mode %Coulomb truncation).

The setup for the three common low-index surfaces of platinum, (100), (110) and (111),
are discussed in the following pages in detail:

+ \subpage Pt100
+ \subpage Pt110
+ \subpage Pt111

After following through these pages you will have x.lattice and x.ionpos files
for each x in 100, 110 and 111.

## Calculations

Now that we have the geometry - lattice and fractional coordinates - of the surfaces,
setting up the calculations is rather straightforward.
We will run vacuum and solvated calculations for each surface,
and our input files will closely resemble those in the \ref SolvationMolecule tutorial;
the differences for the slab geometry will be familiar from the \ref TwoDmaterials tutorial.

First we combine most of the setup in a common input file:

    #Save the following to common.in:
    ion-species GBRV/$ID_pbe_v1.2.uspp
    ion-species GBRV/$ID_pbe_v1.uspp
    elec-cutoff 20 100
    
    coulomb-interaction Slab 001
    coulomb-truncation-embed 0 0 0
    
    kpoint-folding 12 12 1
    elec-fermi-fillings 0 0.01
    electronic-SCF
    #ionic-minimize nIterations 10  #Uncomment to enable geometry optimization

We will run a vacuum calculation starting from the geometry we set up:

    #Save the following to Vacuum.in:
    include common.in
    include ${surface}.lattice
    include ${surface}.ionpos
    dump-name ${surface}-Vacuum.$VAR
    dump End State IonicPositions

These surface calculations are expensive, and to speed them up,
I have disabled geometry optimization in Common.in.
(So by default, all the results will be at the geometry we set up initially.)
You can optionally enable geometry optimization and rerun
the calculations to see how much difference it makes.

We will then run a solvated calculation starting from the final vacuum geometry
(same as initial, unless you enabled geometry optimization) and wavefunctions:

    #Save the following to Solvated.in:
    include common.in
    include ${surface}.lattice
    include ${surface}-Vacuum.ionpos
    initial-state ${surface}-Vacuum.$VAR
    dump End None
    
    fluid LinearPCM
    pcm-variant CANDLE
    fluid-solvent H2O
    fluid-cation Na+ 1.
    fluid-anion F- 1.

As before, this sets up solvation in a 1M aqueous NaF electrolyte.

We can run all the necessary calculations using the script:

    #!/bin/bash
    for surface in 100 110 111; do
        export surface
        jdftx -i Vacuum.in | tee ${surface}-Vacuum.out
        jdftx -i Solvated.in | tee ${surface}-Solvated.out
    done

Save the above to run.sh, give execute permissions using "chmod +x run.sh",
and execute using "./run.sh". This will take a while (~ half hour on a laptop)!

Finally, let's analyze the total energies and electron chemical potentials (mu) of these calculations.
We can calculate the formation energy of the surfaces (in vacuum and solution),
by comparing against the energy of the bulk metal from the \ref Metals tutorial
(scaled to the same number of atoms i.e. 5).
The mu in vacuum is the work function, whereas the mu in solution is
related to the electrode potential at which the surface is neutral,
which is called the potential of zero charge (PZC) of the surface.

We can convert the absolute mu to an electrode potential relative to a reference
such as the standard hydogen electrode (SHE) by knowing the absolute potential
of the reference electrode:

    V_SHE = - (mu - mu_SHE)

There is an overall negative sign due to differences in sign convention for
electrode (reduction) potentials and electron chemical potentials.
Experimentally, mu_SHE is calibrated to -4.44 eV.
Alternately, we can calibrate mu_SHE by comparig theoretical calculations
of the PZC of various metal surfaces against experimental measurements.
We will use this approach, as it tends to cancel systematic errors in the solvation model.
For the CANDLE solvation model, mu_SHE = -4.66 eV (from the CANDLE paper).

We can extract all these results from the output files and print them nicely using the script:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    Ebulk="-88.9330251" #Bulk metal energy per atom
    
    function parseOutputs()
    {
        logFile="$1"
        awk "
            /R =/ {RstartLine=NR}
            NR==RstartLine+3 { Lz = \$4 }           #Height of unit cell
            /unit cell volume/ { A = \$NF*2/Lz}     #Surface area (top+bottom)
            /FillingsUpdate:/ { mu = \$3 }          #Electron chemical potential
            /IonicMinimize: Iter/ { Esurf = (\$5 - $Ebulk*5)/A }  #Surface energy
            END {
                eV = 1/27.2114;
                nm = 1/0.05291772;
                print Esurf/(eV/(nm*nm)), mu/eV     #Output with unit conversion
            }
        " $logFile
    }
    
    #Print header:
    echo "Surface      Esurf [eV/nm^2]           Absolute mu [eV]     V_SHE"
    echo "         Vacuum Solvated  Shift     Vacuum Solvated  Shift   [V]"
    
    #Print results:
    for surface in 100 110 111; do
        EmuVac="$(parseOutputs $surface-Vacuum.out)"
        EmuSol="$(parseOutputs $surface-Solvated.out)"
        echo -n "  $surface   "
        #Print extracted results and solvation differences:
        echo "$EmuVac $EmuSol" | awk '{
            printf("%7.2f %7.2f %7.2f   %7.2f %7.2f %7.2f %7.2f\n",
                $1, $3, $3-$1, $2, $4, $4-$2, -($4-(-4.68))) }'
    done

Save the above to collectResults.sh, give execute permissions using
"chmod +x collectResults.sh", and execute using "./collectResults.sh"
to get the results:

<table>
<tr>
<th rowspan=2> Surface
<th colspan=3> E<sub>surf</sub> [eV/nm<sup>2</sup>]

</table>

Note that the surface formationn energies in vacuum follow the trend (111) < (100) < (110),
indicating that (111) is most stable and (110) is least stable.
This remains the case even in solvent: solvation reduces the formation energies
of all three surfaces (stabilizes the surfaces), but only by a relatively small amount.

The chemical potentials (negative of work function in vacuum / PZC in solution)
also show a similar trend (111) <= (100) < (110).
Solvation shifts up the chemical potentials towards zero
consistently by about 0.3 eV for all three surfaces.

Exercise: what happens with geometry optimization? How much do these results change?
If you have issues with electronic-SCF convergence,
try the stabler but slower electronic-minimize instead.

/** \page Pt100 Pt(100) setup

\image html tutorials/Pt100.png

For (100) surfaces, the surface normal is along a (100) direction i.e. the cube axes.
For a cubic system, all three axes are equivalent and we will pick
the surface normal along the z direction.

Thhe first step is to find a supercell consisting of layers parallel to the surface.
The supercell lattice vectors are integer linear combinations of the original lattice vectors.
Specifically, we need to find the smallest integer linear combinations that satisfy:

1. Two superlattice vectors are perpendicular to the surface normal (i.e. in-plane)
2. The third superlattice vector is parallel to the surface normal

Once again, the original face-centered cubic lattice vectors (in columns) are:

        /  0  a/2 a/2 \
    R = | a/2  0  a/2 |
        \ a/2 a/2  0  /

For the 100 surface, we can get a superlattice vector along the z direction
by adding the first two columns and subtracting the last column,
which corresponds to a linear combination [ 1 1 -1 ].
We now need two linearly-independent superlattice vectors with no z component.
The third column i.e. combination [ 0 0 1] already satisfies this criterion,
and we can get another from the difference of the first two lattice vectors
i.e. the linear combination [ 1 -1 0 ].
Putting these linear combination together *along columns*,
we get the lattice transformation matrix:

        / 0  1  1 \
    M = | 0 -1  1 |
        \ 1  0 -1 /

Multiplying the original lattice vectors R by this transformation matrix,
we would get the superlattice vectors:

                   /  0  a/2 a/2 \   / 0  1  1 \   / a/2 -a/2  0 \
    Rsup = R . M = | a/2  0  a/2 | . | 0 -1  1 | = | a/2  a/2  0 |
                   \ a/2 a/2  0  /   \ 1  0 -1 /   \  0    0   a /

Note that these superlattice vectors are all perpendicular to each other,
with the first two in the x-y plane and the third along z, as desired.
The absolute orientation of the lattice vectors in space do not matter,
we only need to preserve their lengths and the angles between them.
Specifically the above is a tetragonal lattice with square side a/sqrt(2)
and height a, which we could specify using a shorthand in JDFTx as

    latttice Tetragonal ${aBySqrt2} ${a}  #With a/sqrt(2) and a set previously

The determinant of the transformation matrix, det(M) = 2, which means that
det(Rsup) = 2 det(R), or that the volume of the supercell is twice that of the unit cell.
Therefore we would need two atoms per supercell, to get the original crystal again.
We can leave the first atom at fractional coordinates [ 0 0 0 ] in the unit cell.
We can add the second atom at any of the original lattice vectors which has a non-zero
component along the surface normal direction.= eg. [ 1 0 0 ] in the unit cell.
Now we need to transform these fractional coordinates from the unit cell to the supercell,
using the inverse of the transformation matrix, inv(M).
The first atom coordinates [ 0 0 0] of course transform to [ 0 0 0 ],
and for the second atom, the new coordinates are:

             / 1 \    / 1/2  1/2  1 \   / 1 \   / 1/2 \
    inv(M) . | 0 | =  | 1/2 -1/2  0 | . | 0 | = | 1/2 |
             \ 0 /    \ 1/2  1/2  0 /   \ 0 /   \ 1/2 /

Therefore, the fractional atom coordinates for the supercell can be specified as:

    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.0   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5  0.5   1

At this stage, we have the lattice and ionpos for a supercell calculation.
Running JDFTx on this geometry (with appropriate k-point sampling etc.)
would give you exactly the same material properties as on the original
unit cell, except that extensive properties like the total energy
would be twice as large since there are two atoms per unit cell (try it).

Our current supercell has two layers with a 100 surface direction.
The next step is to increase the number of layers, and cleave the crystal
by adding some gap along the to-be non-periodic third direction.
Let's say we want 5 atomic layers, and a minimum gap of 15 bohrs as before.
The layer spacing is a/2 (third supercell lattice vector has length a,
and there are two layers per supercell so far) = 3.705 bohrs,
so 5 empty atomic layers is the minimum number > 15 bohrs of spacing.
Therefore we pick a supercell that has 10 atomic layers i.e. five times as before.
For this, we scale up our third lattice vector by five:

    #Save the following to 100.lattice:
    lattice Tetragonal 5.23966 37.05    #a/sqrt(2) and 5a in bohrs, respectively

The third fractional coordinates of the a tom would then scale down by a factor of five:

    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.0   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5  0.1   1

and we need to repeat this with offsets of 1/5, 2/5 etc. along the third direction.
This would produce layers with the third coordinate ranging from 0.0 to 0.9;
using periodiocity we can wrap third coordinates in the range [0.5,1) to the range [-0.5,0).
Finally, selecting the central five layers, we arrive at the coordinates:

    #Save the following to 100.ionpos:
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0 -0.2   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5 -0.1   1
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.0   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5  0.1   1
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.2   1

We can quickly test the geometry without running a full calculation.
Setup a dummy input file:

    #Save the following to testGeometry.in
    include ${surface}.lattice   #we will use the same input file later for 110 and 111
    include ${surface}.ionpos
    ion-species GBRV/$ID_pbe_v1.2.uspp
    ion-species GBRV/$ID_pbe_v1.uspp
    #Not a real calculation; missing kpoints and fillings!

and run JDFTx using the dry-run (-n) commandline switch:

    export surface="100"   #or "110" or "111" later on
    jdftx -ni testGeometry.in | tee testGeometry-${surface}.out

Examine the output file: it performs initialization and quits.
We can create an XSF file even from this initialization-only output file as usual:

    createXSF testGeometry-${surface}.out ${surface}.xsf

and visualize 100.xsf using VESTA to get an image as shown at the top of the page.

/** \page Pt110 Pt(110) setup

\image html tutorials/Pt110.png

We need to first find appropriate superlattice vectors starting from
the face-centered cubic lattice vectors:

        /  0  a/2 a/2 \
    R = | a/2  0  a/2 |
        \ a/2 a/2  0  /

as discussed in detail in the \ref Pt100 page.

For a (110) surface, we want the surface normal along a direction
which combines two cubic axes with equal coefficients.
Note that the third lattice vector i.e. combination [ 0 0 1 ] already satisfies this property,
so we only need to make the other two lattice vectors perpendicular to this direction.
There are many ways to do this, but the combinations [ 1 -1 0 ] and [ 1 1 -1 ]
satisfy the conditions and produce the smallest possible supercell.
This yields the lattice transformation matrix:

        /  1  1  0 \
    M = | -1  1  0 |
        \  0 -1  1 /

and the superlattice vectors:

            / -a/2  0  a/2 \
    Rsup =  |  a/2  0  a/2 |
            \   0   a   0  /

If you observe carefully, these matrices have the same columns as the \ref Pt100 case, but just in a different order.
This works because the in-plane lattice vectors in our 100 surface setup happen to both be 110 directions.

Once again, we have two atoms and hence two layers per supercell.
For the second atom, we can pick [ 1 0 0 ] as the unit cell fractional coordinate.
Taking that as a column vector and multiplying by inv(M) yields the
supercell fractional coordinates [ 0.5 0.5 0.5 ].
Also note that the three superlattice vectors are orthogonal
with lengths a/sqrt(2), a and a/sqrt(2).
That is technically tetragonal, but in order to keep the lattice vectors in this order
(lattice Tetragonal will make teh first two lattice vectors of equal length),
we can specify it as orthorhombic.
Therefore, we arrive at the supercell input:

    lattice Orthorhombic 5.23966 7.41 5.23966  #a/sqrt(2), a and a/sqrt(2) in bohrs
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.0   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5  0.5   1
    
This time the layer spacing is (a/sqrt(2))/2 = 2.62 bohrs,
so five layers occupy approximately 13 bohrs.
Therefor we need the third lattice vector to be at
least 28 bohrs long to get a 15 bohr vacuum spacing.

We can stretch the third direction by a factor of 28/5.23966,
scaling the third fractional coordinates by 5.23966/28 = 0.18713.
We can then repeat the supercell in both directions with
offsets of 0.18713 in the third fractional coordinate,
till we get at least five atomic layers centered symmetrically
across zero, and then drop the extra layers.
The resulting geometry for the 110 surface is then:

    #Save the following to 110.lattice:
    lattice Orthorhombic 5.23966 7.41 28
    
    
    #Save the following to 110.ionpos:
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0 -0.187130   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5 -0.093565   1
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.000000   1
    ion Pt  0.5  0.5  0.093565   1
    ion Pt  0.0  0.0  0.187130   1

Note that since we are breaking periodicity in the third direction
anyway, we do not need to keep the final supercell equal to
an integer number of atomic layers.
We did that in the 110 setup only for simplicity.

Visualize this geometry using testGeometry.in, JDFTx dry run, createXSF and VESTA
as discussed at the end of the \ref Pt100 page to get an image similar to the one above.

/** \page Pt111 Pt(111) setup

\image html tutorials/Pt111.png

We need to first find appropriate superlattice vectors starting from
the face-centered cubic lattice vectors:

        /  0  a/2 a/2 \
    R = | a/2  0  a/2 |
        \ a/2 a/2  0  /

as discussed in detail in the \ref Pt100 page.

For a (111) surface, we want the surface normal along a direction
which combines all three cubic axes with equal coefficients.
The most obvious combination for this is [ 1 1 1 ], which combines all
three face-centered cubic lattice vectors with equal coefficients as well.
Check that the combinations [ 0 -1 1 ] and [ 1 0 -1 ] produce
superlattice vectors which are orthogonal to the [ 1 1 1 ] combination.
This yields the lattice transformation matrix:

        /  0  1  1 \
    M = | -1  0  1 |
        \  1 -1  1 /

and the superlattice vectors:

            /   0  -a/2  a \
    Rsup =  |  a/2   0   a |
            \ -a/2  a/2  a /

Note that this time, the first two lattice vectors are orthogonal
to the third (required), but not to each other.
The in-plane lattice vectors instead have an angle of 120 degrees between them.
(Their dot product divided by their lengths gives you the cosine.)
For the 111 surface, this is the optimum super-cell and orthogonal
in-plane lattice vectors are only possible with a larger
less-efficient supercell (with more than one atom per layer).
To sumamrize, we have the first two superlattice vectors of 
equal length a/sqrt(2) = 5.23966 bohrs at a 120 degree angle,
and a third of length sqrt(3)a = 12.8345 bohrs at right angles to the first two;
we can specify this using the Hexagonal shorthand in JDFTx.

Additionally, det(M) = 3 which means that we need three atoms in the supercell.
We can start with [ 0 0 0 ], [ 0 0 1 ] and [ 0 0 -1 ] in unit-cell fractional coordinates.
The first one remains invariant upon transforming to the supercell, as before.
Taking the second one as a column vector and multiplying by inv(M) yields [ 1/3 -1/3 1/3 ].
The third one is the negative of the second one,
and we end up with the initial supercell geometry
(after sorting the atoms by their third coordinate):

    lattice Hexagonal 5.23966 12.8345  #a/sqrt(2) and sqrt(3)a in bohrs
    ion Pt -0.333333  0.333333 -0.333333   1
    ion Pt  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   1
    ion Pt  0.333333 -0.333333  0.333333   1

The layer spacing is 12.8345/3 = 4.3 bohrs, so that 5 layers occupy approximately 21 bohrs.
For 15 bohrs vacuum spacing, we need a unit cell length of 36 bohrs.
Correspondingly, the scale factor for the third fractional coordinate
and the offset between supercell repetitions equals 12.8345/36 = 0.356514.
Adding repetitions and dropping extra layers, we then arrive at the geometry:

    #Save the following to 111.lattice:
    lattice Hexagonal 5.23966 36
    
    
    #Save the following to 111.ionpos:
    ion Pt  0.333333 -0.333333 -0.237676   1
