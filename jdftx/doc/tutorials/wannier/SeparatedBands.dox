/** \page SeparatedBands Separated bands

This tutorial will introduce the calculation of maximally-localized %Wannier
functions (MLWFs) for a set of bands that are separated in energies from other bands.
This is applicable for the occupied valence bands of semiconductors and insulators.
Here, we will construct and visualize %Wannier functions for silicon in the diamond structure,
and demonstrate band-structure interpolation using MLWF-based <i>ab initio</i> tight-binding models.
